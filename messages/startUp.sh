var=("Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight." 
"If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in."
"Nine people canâ€™t make a baby in a month." 
"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, ifyou write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smartenough to debug it." 
"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live." 
"When debugging, novices insert corrective code; experts remove defective code." 
"Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program" 
"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write  code that humans can understand"
"One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code." 
"Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life." )

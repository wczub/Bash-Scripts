# email.sh
## What this does
This is a script to email files off of a server using mutt. I made this for getting files off of my university's server. This also allowed me to share files with friends without having to download it and then send it to them. 
## How to make it work
Copy this file onto your server, and make it an executable. Then you just call it with the file as the parameter, or file and email as the parameters.
I personally have my own "bin" folder that I added to my $PATH variable, and changed it to just be "email". This way no matter which folder I'm in I can type "email fileName".
